******************************Conclusion******************************

This web map provides a user with geolocation markers of every film shot in a year chosen by a user,
with use of which he/she can assume in which country, region or continent the cinematograph was the most productive
and maybe developed. Using two other layers with markers of films shot ten and twenty years ago accordingly,
the user can analyze how the things in cinema industry changed during decades and gain some interesting information.
The layer which paints the countries into different colors helps the user to orientate on the map and match
the number of movies filmed in the country to it's area
